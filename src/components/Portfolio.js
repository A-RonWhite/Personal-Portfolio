      copy="Tabb is a CRUD app that allows you to save useful links and set tags to keep them easily organised, built with React on the front-end and Express on the back-end. I used React hooks through-out the project and it was my first time using a back-end language to create my own API. Context was also used to handle state management which was a concept I struggled to get my head round to begin with but got to grips with it and it's benefits by the end of the project. Redux is something I would like to try and use in a future project to provide a comparison between them. Postman was a lifesaver when it came to testing my CRUD methods at the beginning of the project and saved me a lot of headaches debugging when something went wrong."

They wanted something that was well designed and met their branding with enough information to entice customers into their newly opened showroom. I had to work to a tight deadline to provide them with a site before their opening date, the full site is currently being developed in Wordpress and is linked below in 'Other Sites'."

Domus sell a vast amount of different flooring products each with a multitude of specifications and relevant information to the customer so UX was a big priority for them. This meant a lot of time was spent tweaking designs and layouts to create an easy and fluid customer journey whilst also making all the necessary details easy to find. Through-out the process I acted as a consultant when meeting and dealing with the agency hired to develop the site."
