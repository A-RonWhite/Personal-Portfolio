        After completing a Graphic Design degree I quickly transitioned into
        front-end development by creating a strong foundation in semantic HTML
        and CSS. My current focus has been exploring and improving upon my
        JavaScript knowledge within the various popular frameworks but with a
        desire to transition into becoming a full stack developer.
