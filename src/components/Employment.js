      <h3>Freelance Web Development</h3>
      <p>
        My freelance work to date consists of developing smaller websites for
        start ups or re-designing existing sites. My Graphic Design education
        helped me in my freelance work due to most clients generally wanting
        someone to do everything (logo, site design/layout, branding etc). This
        has given me the freedom to develop and try out different stacks/
        workflows over the past few years. The experience working with clients
        to a deadline as well as keep their needs in mind at every step has been
        amazing experience that will lend well into any future jobs.
